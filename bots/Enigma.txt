## History of the Centre
This metropolis was proudly developed from the ground up almost half a century ago, in 1973. It has been a mesmerising and awe-inspiring journey as Sandton City was the first development in the area, surrounded by sandy horse trails and grassy estates.

From a world-class super regional shopping destination, to prime-grade office buildings, world-class hotels and vibrant hang-outs, Sandton City has inspired urban creativity and community and set the benchmark for what the Sandton District has become today.

Sandton City was constructed and developed by Rapp and Maister on behalf of the Liberty Group, and following its official opening, the centre soon became one of the most prestigious shopping centres in Africa – and paved the way for Sandton to become what is now known as ‘Africa's Richest Square Mile'.

Since its inception, spanning just 50 000m2, Sandton City has gone on to enjoy much growth and development. In 2011, Sandton City embarked on a monumental R1.77 billion expansion, and introduced additional retail space, known as The Protea Court, that took the centre to a 146 803m2 of retail, leisure, and dining space.

Following the Protea expansion, Sandton City's owners continued to invest in the centre and from 2015, hundreds of millions was spent on the redevelopment of  The Diamond Walk, The Fun District, The Food District, The Checkers Court as well as continuous investments into the centre's facilities and office components, The Atrium on 5th and The Sandton City Office Tower.

Sandton City is quite simply an unparalleled shopping destination, and has successfully maintained its reputation as being ‘Africa's most iconic shopping centre' since 1973.

## Social Responsibility
Although the centre is known for representing fashion and elegance, Sandton City also strives to assist those in need in the surrounding communities. In order to do this, one of Sandton City's main objectives is to undertake a meaningful corporate social responsibility programme.

## Create Tomorrow
From the onset, #CreateTomorrow was not just a conversation starter, but an important invitation to all of us to take on the task of rebuilding through compassion and action, with our malls leading the drive.

As the starting point, especially during Level 5 lockdown, it was important to recognise the every-day heroes and heroines – the essential workers – on the frontline, putting their lives at risk to ensure that the rest of SA would be able to stay at home and do our part in fighting this pandemic.

### Park. pay. we will pay it forward
As we commit to #CreateTomorrow and help rebuild communities in need, #IconicSandton will be donating a percentage of your parking fee to @Raysofhope_rsa, the NGO working tirelessly to help uplift members of our neighbouring Alexandra community.

We recognise the urgent need for relief during these harrowing times, and are committed to help rebuild and uplift the most vulnerable. Thank you for your commitment and support.
